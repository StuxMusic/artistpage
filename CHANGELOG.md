## v1.0.0

### Added

- Initial release: a placeholder page shown when a Stux.Music artist hasn't
  set up their page yet, with self-hosted Font Awesome (matching Stux.Music's
  actual design), a "Boring Legal Stuff" legal hub (`legal.html` + `legal/`),
  `changelog.html` that fetches and renders `CHANGELOG.md` at runtime, a
  version indicator fetched live from `VERSION.md`, cross-origin
  `postMessage` title sync, `dev-server.sh` / `dev-server.bat`, and a custom
  `404.html` error page
